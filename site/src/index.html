      <h1>Welcome to LicenseDB!</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to the License Database project (aka LicenseDB).  Our
        goal is to build a structured database of all copyright (and
        related rights) licenses used in the free software / open
        source / free culture communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is still being set-up, so there's not much here
        yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talk to warp on freenode irc if you want to know more.
