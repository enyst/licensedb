      <h1>About the License Database Project</h1>

      <p>
        The License Database project aims to build a structured
        database of all copyright licenses used in the free software /
        open source / free culture communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Various tools can benefit from a full set of machine-readable
        licenses, including tools which we haven't thought of yet.
        Feel free to contact us if you have ideas to make this project
        useful for a particular use-case.
      </p>

      <h2>How to help</h2>
      <p>
        The License Database project is a very new project, our first
        goal is to collect or create RDF/XML files for all the
        licenses which have an assigned identifier in the SPDX license
        list and for all the creative commons licenses.  These will be
        made available on https://licensedb.org/ in both RDF/XML and
        JSON-LD formats.  Obviously the entire database can be
        downloaded as well.
      </p>

      <p>
