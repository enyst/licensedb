QuickStart
==========

You will need:

    - a recent version (0.8.x) of nodejs with npm
    - raptor2 (http://librdf.org/raptor/)
    - the commandline version of php
    - python 2.7
    - GNU Make.

On Ubuntu 12.04 you will have to install node manually, but the rest can be
installed with:

   sudo apt-get install raptor2-utils php5-cli python2.7 python-virtualenv make

The python scripts need requests and rdflib, you can set up a virtualenv
for that by running the included bin/bootstrap.sh script.


Hosting
=======

The License Database project website (which includes the database) is
currently hosted using nginx, with a small node server to do content
negotiation.  A daemontools service directory is included as
etc/service/ and the nginx configuration as etc/nginx.conf.
