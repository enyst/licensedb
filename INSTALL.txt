QuickStart

You will need ruby and the "linkeddata" gem, you could install it with
the following steps:

  1. get RVM, https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/
  2. rvm requirements
  3. rvm install 1.9.2
  4. rvm 1.9.2 do gem install linkeddata
  5. rvm use 1.9.2

You will also need the commandline version of php and GNU Make.

More info
=========

To convert between RDF/XML, JSON-LD and any other formats used by the
License Database project you will need RDF.rb and most of its plugins.
If you already have a working ruby setup you can install these with
"gem install linkeddata".  The QuickStart instructions above recommend
using "RVM", which is somewhat similar in purpose as perl's local::lib
and python's virtualenv.

Once you have installed the linkeddata gem you can check that everything
is working with the following command:

    rdf serialize --output-format jsonld http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/rdf


Hosting
=======

The License Database project website (which includes the database) is
currently hosted using apache, add the following rules to the apache
config to allow content negotiation. (so that https://licensedb.org/ns
returns ns.html, and https://licensedb.org/id/LGPL-2.1 can return
html, json and RDF based on the accept header of the client)

        Options +MultiViews
        AddType     application/rdf+xml     rdf
        AddType     application/json        json
        AddType     application/ld+json     jsonld
