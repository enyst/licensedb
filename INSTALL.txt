More info
=========

To convert between RDF/XML, JSON-LD and any other formats used by the
License Database project you will need RDF.rb and most of its plugins.
If you already have a working ruby setup you can install these with
"gem install linkeddata".  The QuickStart instructions above recommend
using "RVM", which is somewhat similar in purpose as perl's local::lib
and python's virtualenv.

Once you have installed the linkeddata gem you can check that everything
is working with the following command:

    rdf serialize --output-format jsonld http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/rdf
